Melakukan normalisasi data, yaitu mengubah setiap nilai ke dalam rentang antara 0 hingga 1. Kita akan menggunakan metode min-max, yaitu: x - min / max - min. Terdapat juga rumus-rumus lain yang dapat digunakan, misalnya metode simple feature scaling atau metode z-score. Namun perlu diingat bahwa kolom target tidak akan dinormalisasi (kolom species)."],"metadata":{"id":"ITzY6-ncdZQ3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["target_column = df_copy['target']\n","df_copy =
